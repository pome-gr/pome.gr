We just released pome v0.0.1.    

The core features that are implemented in this release let you record accounting transactions while handling the underlying git accounting repository for you!

**Disclamer:** pome is still very early software and in active development. Expect breaking changes in the releases to come with no guaranteed backward compatibility.
